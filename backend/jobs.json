    "description": "<h1><strong>What is Loancrate?</strong></h1><p>We started Loancrate to make home-buying simpler and less expensive for lenders and borrowers (us!). Today, mortgage lenders are stuck running their companies on software products built 20 years ago. These products are slow, unstable and donât lead to material improvements in efficiency. When using these systems, the average human cost to originate a loan is still over $11,000.</p><p>Loancrate builds AI native tooling to automate mortgage workflows. Our ultimate goal is fully automated origination, which has the potential to save lenders over $16B in operating expense per year.</p><p>Since starting in 2020, our remote team has enabled our customers to power &gt;$85 billion in new home loans. We are a group of people excited to tackle the complexity of the home-lending industry. We care about collaboration, very open communication covering the good &amp; the bad so that we learn from our decisions quickly, and ultimately having fun while we're building. You'll fit in well if you like diving deep quickly!</p><p><br /></p><h1><strong>The Opportunity</strong></h1><p>Our dreams are big and we have much to build! We're looking for senior software engineers to help lead our team in powering the future of home buying in the US (which could entail managing a majority of US home loans every year â financial assets worth trillions of dollars).</p><p>We are excited to offer competitive salary and equity for this role.</p><p><br /></p><h1><strong>What To Expect</strong></h1><p>As an engineer at Loancrate, you'll continue our team tradition by shipping code to production on your first day! Following that, within your first month, you'll dive into your first mission-critical project, such as...</p><p>ð Architecting, building, and launching complex, multi-step AI agents that our customers use to digitize their ops workflows and save millions of dollars per year.</p><p>ð¤ Integrating with 3rd-party providers of lending services APIs to generate documents/disclosures, produce automated underwriting results, or prevent fraud.</p><p>ð Architecting, building, and launching the next generation of our job processing infrastructure on AWS to make Loancrate's back end more observable and reliable.</p><p><br /></p><h1><strong>Tech Stack</strong></h1><p>Nearly all of our code is written in TypeScript. We use React on the frontend, Node/Express on the backend (running inside Docker), GraphQL/Apollo on both sides, and Postgres as our database. We use AWS (ECS, RDS, ElastiCache, Kafka, ElasticSearch, and more) and manage all of our infrastructure with Terraform.</p><p>We believe that high engineering velocity drives high product velocity (and, in turn, our success as a company ð). Keeping this in mind, we've invested heavily in creating a great developer experience that enables engineers to ship fast. Some highlights of our stack:</p><p>âï¸ <strong>End-to-End Type Safety</strong> - We generate TypeScript types from our Postgres and GraphQL schemas so that when we change our database schema we see type errors in any incompatible frontend React components.</p><p>ð <strong>Full-Stack Code Sharing</strong> - Our build tooling supports seamless sharing of TypeScript files between the client, server, and other packages in our mono-repo so that we never have to define functions or configuration values twice.</p><p>ð  <strong>Reproducible Infrastructure</strong> - Weâve used Terraform to manage 100% of our infrastructure since day 1 and have configured our CI pipeline to automatically deploy temporary staging environments for every pull request. We use these per-PR environments to get feedback from teammates and test any infrastructure changes using infrastructure that's identical to production.</p><p>ð§ª <strong>First Class Testing Utilities</strong> - We have a comprehensive library of utilities that mock production-like data and feed automated end-to-end, integration, and performance tests. Our wide-ranging test suite allows us to move fast while maintaining nearly perfect uptime.</p><p><br /></p><h1><strong>Preferred Skills and Background</strong></h1><p><em>(It's okay not to have all of these things - these are just some skills we are excited about!)</em></p><p>ð¤ Familiarity with modern AI product development lifecycles (evals, experiment design, dataset curation, etc). We donât just build AI chat bots. We wrangle non-deterministic LLMs into reliable mission-critical systems.</p><p>ð A constant and keen eye for security risks â we store and display some of people's most sensitive personal data and need to keep it safe!</p><p>ð¨ A desire to be product-oriented, from thinking through the product implications of what you're building to contributing your unique ideas of how to improve the product.</p><p>ðï¸ Ability to develop readable, maintainable, and effective software architecture patterns that support use of our product by various enterprise customers (each with thousands of employees and their own methods for running their companies).</p><p>ð©âð«ð¨âð« Excitement to mentor less senior engineers in both hard and soft skills.</p><p>ð SRE-oriented mindset for developing infrastructure that's reliable, observable, and requires minimal toil to maintain.</p><p>ð©ï¸ Experience scaling high-throughput distributed systems in the cloud. Bonus points if you're experienced with infrastructure-as-code solutions like Terraform or CloudFormation!</p><p>ð§ Ability to develop full-stack web app features from design through deployment.</p><p>ð¢ï¸ Experience designing and scaling complex relational DB schemas, as well as figuring out performant ways to store, retrieve, and update such data. Home loans have thousands of data fields ð.</p><br/><br/>Please mention the word **WONDEROUSLY** and tag RMzQuNzQuMTA3Ljgw when applying to show you read the job post completely (#RMzQuNzQuMTA3Ljgw).

    "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">At LaunchBrightly, we are on a mission to automate <a href=\"https://launchbrightly.com/product.html\">a process that continually captures and enhances screenshots of all your SaaS product features</a>. The continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline and process that engineers adopted over the last decade, is what we ultimately want to build for customer support teams. TLDR; LaunchBrightly = Github Actions/Circle CI for customer support. And we are currently looking to bring onboard a strong <strong>Application Engineer</strong>.Â </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Everyone at LaunchBrightly is a creator, an owner, or perhaps better, a celebration of the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. Most big companies are afraid of entrusting the future of the company and their software to a few makers, and as they defend against that, they end up with three layers of managers and a product designed by a committee. We want the opposite. We need the opposite as we enter virgin territory trying to build that CI/CD pipeline and process for the support organization. As our customer pushes a new feature to production, we automatically update all product images within the help center. This is a thrilling adventure!</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Our work is remote, not distant. We believe that being a remote-first organization allows us to build an exceptional team composed of makers and sellers with diverse backgrounds and skill sets from around the globe. Our default work culture is asynchronous and emphasizes written communication to prioritize maker time, focus and company productivity. Our goal is not to eliminate face-to-face interaction, but we should default to a setting where written documentation is so strong that a meeting on most project subject matters would seem odd.Â Â </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Founded in 2022, and backed by prominent venture firms including IA Ventures, Tuesday Capital, and B Capital Group, this is a unique opportunity to join this band of misfits on the ground floor. As an early teammate you will be working intimately with the founding team, who has done 0 to 1 five times over while seeing four of them come to an exit.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The <strong>Application Engineer</strong> will become an integral member of an intimate 9-person team consisting of:</p><ul><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Maker #7 (Application Engineer, You!)</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Maker #6 (Melissa, Implementation Specialist)</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Maker #5 (Michel, Frontend Engineer)</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Maker #4 (Lucas, Frontend Engineer)</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Maker #3 (Jose, Fullstack Engineer)</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Maker #2 (Hyder, Backend Engineer)</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Maker #1 (<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/dennismortensen\">Dennis</a>, Founder)</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Seller #1 (<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshuacpeacock/\">Josh</a>, Co-founder)</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Helper #1 (Vibeke)</p></li></ul><p dir=\"ltr\">However, we are looking not just for an Engineer but, rather, a teammate we see as integral to LaunchBrightlyâs long-term journey and vital to our success. Someone who is comfortable in the dark and who sees a certain romance, like we do, in embracing the unknowns that come with being on the startup journey. We have a track record of seeing those colleagues who join us on the ground floor of our ventures ride the startup journey to completion (exit) with us, as we grow and become successful together. This is something we take seriously, and something we are extremely proud of!Â </p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">Job Description</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">You'll work with Jose (and the remainder of the team) on the logic layer that powers our product: workflows, task runners, state machines, rules engines, and orchestration. You'll work in Typescript directly in the Vue App, and often in JS in AWS Lambdaâs, tune our data models, and shape how primary product features like Audits function behind the scenes. You're not building APIs or UI â you're building the actual product behavior. Think of yourself as a Product Logic &amp; State Orchestration Engineer.Â </p><p dir=\"ltr\">This is a hands-on role for an engineer who loves building reliable systems that model real-world processes. Youâll work on the internal state machines that govern how screenshots flow through the system, are transformed, enhanced, and delivered. Youâll define rules engines that let non-technical users control automated behavior, manage task orchestration across Lambda and queues, and shape our schema design to handle complex edge cases with clarity and performance in mind.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Youâll thrive in this role if you think deeply about how complex systems behave over time, have strong opinions on data modeling and event-driven workflows, and enjoy writing deterministic, testable, observable logic. If you care more about product behavior than presentation, and love turning business intent into robust execution â this is for you!</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">We are looking for previous experience working with</h2><ul><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Building production-grade B2B web apps, including everything that comes with robust, scalable software: business logic, testing, observability, and performance.</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Writing TypeScript in a modern frontend architecture (Vue 3 SPA) and JavaScript in AWS Lambda functions.</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Working deeply to create meaningful and maintainable test coverage across core business logic (e.g. Vitest).</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Designing and modeling robust data schemas for DynamoDB and GraphQL queries, with a strong intuition for how data shapes product behavior.</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Consuming and reviewing internal APIs using Postman, and contributing clear, actionable feedback to improve them.</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Implementing Serverless architecture with AWS Amplify, including event-driven flows and task orchestration.</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Having a good functional understanding of UI-layer concerns (HTML, DOM, TailwindCSS, HeadlessUI), but focusing your energy on what happens beneath the surface â the orchestration, rules, and workflows that make the app tick.</p></li></ul><h2 dir=\"ltr\">What you bring to the table</h2><ul><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Minimum of 3 years of industry experience</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\">A customer-first mentality, with an instinct to imagine how users will react and interact</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Strong and precise communication and documentation skills, with a will to understand and be understood</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Prides themselves on writing highly readable, thoroughly tested code</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\">The personal organization skills and patience to manage multiple contexts as projects and features come together.

This is not about managing infrastructure but about making sure that our software uses the hardware resources wisely and flexibly.

This requires good knowledge of storage, networking, and computing</li><li>Disaster recovery: improving our tooling to manage and discover problems, but also improving our on-call procedures</li><li>As a specific challenge: when our customers grow, we need to upgrade their accounts. Now, we do it manuallyânot in the traditional sense of manual because we have tools that automate much of the process, but we need to take care of that one customer at a time: deciding what machines we need to spin-up, how much compute capacity we will provision, etc. Ideally, our architecture should allow our customers to upgrade themselves and assign more resources to them dynamically and seamlessly in the most dynamic, safe and transparent way possible.</li></ul><p><br></p><b>What you bring:</b><ul><li>Experience designing, building and running distributed Cloud architectures and large scale web based applications.

At Tinybird, we work mostly with Python and C++</li><li>Accountable and enthusiastic to take on the responsibility of designing and managing the platform, and an urge to take on things that may be broken.

Industry giants like Adobe and IBM trust our courses to train their teams, and prestigious universities such as MIT and the University of Cambridge use our materials in their curricula.</p><p>Weâve assembled anÂ <strong>exceptional team of unicorns</strong>Â who support, inspire, and challenge each other every day. We wake up each morning excited to build a brighter future for millions of people around the world.</p><p>But somethingâs missing. And we thinkÂ <strong>it could be you</strong>.</p><p>This is a role for someone who can âwalk the talk.â Weâre not looking for a self-proclaimed âbrand ninjaâ or âmarketing rockstar.â We want aÂ <strong>builder,Â </strong>someone who knows how to get things done, shows proof, not pitch, and lives for measurable outcomes.</p><h2><strong>Do You Share the Vision of IxDF?</strong></h2><p>People donât just buy our courses; they invest in a better version of themselves. Thatâs why every campaign and content piece we create must do more than âmarket.â It must reflect what we believe in as a brand:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Show the dream outcome:</strong>Â Help people imagine a future of creative, meaningful work, freedom, fulfillment, flexibility, and impact through great design.</p></li><li><p><strong>Strengthen belief in success:</strong>Â Build confidence through real stories, practical roadmaps, and expert-led guidance. People should feel, âIf they did it, I can too.â</p></li><li><p><strong>Speed up the time to value:</strong>Â Offer instant wins. Make progress feel close and tangible not someday, but now.</p></li><li><p><strong>Lower the effort barrier:</strong>Â Make it feel doable. No jargon. No overwhelm. Just human, beginner-friendly, bite-sized steps that meet people where they are.</p></li></ul><p>Your job would be to translate this into headlines, hooks, content pieces, social media posts, campaigns, and data-informed strategy. Youâll create clarity, motivation, and momentum with a dash of unicorn magic.</p><h2><strong>What You Will Be Doing</strong></h2><p>Youâll be at the core of our growth engine, running and optimizing the systems that bring learners into our ecosystem. You will:</p><ul><li><p>Create, own and scaleÂ <strong>organic content</strong>Â that earns attention, builds trust, and drives long-term growth across platforms.</p></li><li><p>Plan and executeÂ <strong>high-impact campaigns</strong>Â for events like Black Friday, New Year, Unicorn Day, and Global Accessibility Awareness Day. Youâll turn briefs into successful results and reports into actionable insights.</p></li><li><p>Experiment withÂ <strong>new channels</strong>Â like TikTok, Reddit, YouTube Shortsâlaunching quick pilots and scaling what works.</p></li><li><p>Build and maintain clear,Â <strong>concise documentation</strong>Â and reporting dashboards to make campaign operations more transparent, repeatable, and effective.</p></li><li><p>UseÂ <strong>analytics to learn and iterate</strong>, not just report. Your campaigns get smarter every time.</p></li><li><p>Champion our value propositionâbe aÂ <strong>brand ambassador</strong>Â for our mission, bringing our voice, vision, and values to life across every touchpoint.</p></li><li><p>Run and scaleÂ <strong>paid media</strong>Â on Meta, Google, LinkedIn, and YouTube.

More specifically:</p><ul><li><p>You bringÂ <strong>storytelling and creativity</strong>Â to your work and can craft organic content that captures attention and connects with users.</p></li><li><p>You have a sixth sense for micro-copy, and the know-how toÂ <strong>write</strong>Â <strong>persuasive, on-brand copy</strong>Â that drives action.</p></li><li><p>You haveÂ <strong>experience with</strong>Â <strong>launching</strong>Â <strong>campaigns</strong>Â across owned and paid platforms and have the track record to show it.</p></li><li><p>You areÂ <strong>comfortable with platforms</strong>Â like Meta Ads Manager, Google Ads, and LinkedIn Campaign Manager, and you understand their constraints and superpowers.</p></li><li><p>You donât just launch ads, youÂ <strong>improve everything around them</strong>: the copy, the images, the funnel, the flow, the analytics.</p></li><li><p>Youâre driven byÂ <strong>impact and fluent in data</strong>Â - you use metrics to uncover insights, guide decisions, and optimize performance. But you also understand human behavior, platform psychology, and what makes a message truly land.</p></li><li><p>You view AI not as a threat or a substitution for that infamous human touch but as aÂ <strong>force multiplier of your human capabilities</strong>. You use AI to build faster, smarter, and better results.</p></li><li><p>You have aÂ <strong>keen eye for content</strong>, and you can quickly understand what type of content is meaningful, appropriate and useful in each situation or each platform.</p></li><li><p>You areÂ <strong>fluent in written English</strong>Â with exceptional writing skills, grammar and an appreciation for the power of tone, brevity and microscopy.</p></li><li><p>You areÂ <strong>based within the UTC -1 to UTC +3 time zone,</strong>Â which is crucial to ensure optimal collaboration and overlapping working hours.</p></li></ul><h2><strong>Bonus points</strong></h2><p>You stand out if you...</p><ul><li><p>Have experience creating or managingÂ <strong>video-centric campaigns</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Know your way aroundÂ <strong>GA4, GTM, and server-side tagging</strong>.</p></li></ul><h2><strong>What We Can Offer</strong></h2><ul><li><p>AÂ <strong>full-time position</strong>, within a fully remote organization.
